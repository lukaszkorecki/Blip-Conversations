# Blip Conversations

This tool is simillar to [BlipTools](http://bliptools.appspot.com/thread/22736718/) and proposed (and expected) [Blip.pl](http://blip.pl) feature upcoming in their new API release.

So... Why wait?

This app resolves quoted (nested) urls to other statuses and shows them as conversations (or comment threads).

Available in both HTML and JSON can be easily read or digested by 3rd party client applications.

Version 0.0.0.1 alpha, not salted
